Bus Boy,,,,,,,,
Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.

But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.

I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.

It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).

Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema!

Wow!,"I was not expecting that, I had visions of a film along the same lines as Snake Eyes, that was an out of date bagel, this was a four course banquet.

Fast paced, energetic, and relentless, not particularly the genre I normally go to, or enjoy, but I loved every second of it, a visual masterpiece. Superb acting, terrific musics, but it's produced in such a magical way, it is stunning.

I plan on seeing this again, just to understand a few bits a little more.

Go and watch it, you'll love it, 9/10.",I was not expecting that  I had visions of a film along the same lines as Snake Eyes  that was an out of date bagel  this was a four course banquet   Fast paced  energetic  and relentless  not particularly the genre I normally go to  or enjoy  but I loved every second of it  a visual masterpiece  Superb acting  terrific musics  but it s produced in such a magical way  it is stunning   I plan on seeing this again  just to understand a few bits a little more   Go and watch it  you ll love it  9 10 ,I was not expecting that  I had visions of a film along the same lines as Snake Eyes  that was an out of date bagel  this was a four course banquet   Fast paced  energetic  and relentless  not particularly the genre I normally go to  or enjoy  but I loved every second of it  a visual masterpiece  Superb acting  terrific musics  but it s produced in such a magical way  it is stunning   I plan on seeing this again  just to understand a few bits a little more   Go and watch it  you ll love it  9 10 ,I was not expecting that  I had visions of a film along the same lines as Snake Eyes  that was an out of date bagel  this was a four course banquet   Fast paced  energetic  and relentless  not particularly the genre I normally go to  or enjoy  but I loved every second of it  a visual masterpiece  Superb acting  terrific musics  but it s produced in such a magical way  it is stunning   I plan on seeing this again  just to understand a few bits a little more   Go and watch it  you ll love it    ,I expecting I visions film along lines Snake Eyes date bagel four course banquet Fast paced energetic relentless particularly genre I normally go enjoy I loved every second visual masterpiece Superb acting terrific musics produced magical way stunning I plan seeing understand bits little Go watch love,i expecting i visions film along lines snake eyes date bagel four course banquet fast paced energetic relentless particularly genre i normally go enjoy i loved every second visual masterpiece superb acting terrific musics produced magical way stunning i plan seeing understand bits little go watch love,i   e x p e c t i n g   i   v i s i o n s   f i l m   a l o n g   l i n e s   s n a k e   e y e s   d a t e   b a g e l   f o u r   c o u r s e   b a n q u e t   f a s t   p a c e d   e n e r g e t i c   r e l e n t l e s s   p a r t i c u l a r l y   g e n r e   i   n o r m a l l y   g o   e n j o y   i   l o v e d   e v e r y   s e c o n d   v i s u a l   m a s t e r p i e c e   s u p e r b   a c t i n g   t e r r i f i c   m u s i c s   p r o d u c e d   m a g i c a l   w a y   s t u n n i n g   i   p l a n   s e e i n g   u n d e r s t a n d   b i t s   l i t t l e   g o   w a t c h   l o v e,i e x p e c t i n g i v i s i o n s f i l m a l o n g l i n e s s n a k e e y e s d a t e b a g e l f o u r c o u r s e b a n q u e t f a s t p a c e d e n e r g e t i c r e l e n t l e s s p a r t i c u l a r l y g e n r e i n o r m a l l y g o e n j o y i l o v e d e v e r y s e c o n d v i s u a l m a s t e r p i e c e s u p e r b a c t i n g t e r r i f i c m u s i c s p r o d u c e d m a g i c a l w a y s t u n n i n g i p l a n s e e i n g u n d e r s t a n d b i t s l i t t l e g o w a t c h l o v e

Visually spectacular if maybe a little bit flat on the story front.,"Having just enjoyed a series of Wong Kar-wei films, it was great to see the star of many of his classic features - Tony Leung - feature in this superior fantasy adventure. He is the man with the magical and all-powerful ten rings and two estranged children. It is only when his son ""Shaun"" (Simu Liu) has a lively altercation with some heavies on a San Francisco bus that he realises there is impending danger, seeks out his independently minded sister and before you know it, the family are - somewhat unwillingly - reunited and working together to rescue their late, lamented mother from the clutches of an evil being protected by a benign society led by Michelle Yeoh. To be honest, the story isn't the best - it's actually a little bit simple and predictable. That said, however, the characterisations are engaging and the action scenes are well staged and paced. There is an interesting underlying premiss that has to resonate now as the planet appears to be fighting back against mankind's accumulated indifference - the Elysian utopia that ""Xu Wenwu"" (Leung) must invade to rescue his wife being symbolic of the unspoilt elements of the planet that have no intention of rolling over peaceably whilst we impose ourselves on it. The production standards are typically high, with plenty of cute and dangerous beasties to suit and please all ages. There is also quite a fun series of scenes from Sir Ben Kingsley as a Liverpudlian poet (maybe his accent isn't the best!) before a stylishly crafted finale. All told, this is a thoroughly entertaining watch that at over two hours flies by.",Having just enjoyed a series of Wong Kar wei films  it was great to see the star of many of his classic features

Indeed legendary,"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.

Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".

The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.

This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.",It s been ten years since Shang Chi Liu  charming  stoic  last saw his father  and

Ten Years too Late,,,,,,,,
A Marvel for the whole family.,"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)

This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.

The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.

When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.

Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies.", The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange   Wenwu  Tony Leung   This quote is typical of the light hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is

The Asian Panda,,,,,,,,
my eyes couldn't handle the sheer awesomeness on the screen,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth it

WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.

I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).

The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.

This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes

Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.

Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.

Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.

Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.

It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.

What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.

Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnn

after endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow

All in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.

If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.

I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to!

Wick series and Netflix s Daredevil as some of the best we ve seen in America lately  I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie  far too early  Lol  I be stupid sometimes  Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain  Nope  Awesome awesome awesome  That s all i ll say   Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores  with some exceptions  don t stand out  I think they heard  They re on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow  It s not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it  It felt unique to this new franchise   Still so much more to say  need to go faster  This is one of the best  maybe THE best  story in the MCU  especially the way it s told  I loved all the characters  i loved all the casting choices  i loved the performances  There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps  All the emotional moments hit  All the callbacks hit  There isn t anything that didn t work for me  There s no such thing as a perfect movie  but mannnnnn   Lmao i didn t mention the cinematography  Why would i wait this long  It s MESMERIZING  A lot  Throughout  It s candy for your eyes   It s also nice to see well written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters  that feels organic  As opposed to the  insert joke here  method we ve been seeing more of  especially in Far From Home   What s the opposite of formulaic  That s this movie  I never knew what to expect next  helps that i didn t watch a single trailer  they ruin movies   Definitely doesn t feel like a typical MCU movie  It has it s own unique tone and feel and character   Continuing what i said in my headline  i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up  not from an emotional moment  but from a scene being so incredible  especially action scenes  Don t know why it happens  don t know if it happens to other ppl  Maybe it s partly because i can t risk blinking  That happened in this movie numerous times  Like  this is the coolest thing i ve ever seen in my life   hyperbole  but mannnnn  after endgame finished phase 3  yes i know spider man   i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU  But i wasn t sure they could ever recapture that magic again  I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome  But i wasn t expecting top tier stuff any more  Lol  I be stupid sometimes  I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated  As of now  this is a top 6 MCU movie for me  Wow  All in all  i adore this movie  You may wonder why i wouldn t give it a 10 after all this raving  10s are super rare for me  only 13 of them  and i watch thousands of movies  Interstellar  inception  mad max fury road  etc  Movies that shouldn t even be called movies  My 9s are rare too  they are my favorite movies  10s are my favorites of my favorites  Only superhero movies i ve given 10s are dark knight  dark knight rises and civil war   If you re still reading  wow you re awesome  I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar   I m still in such a good mood  I can t wait to watch it again  in IMAX  I want to wait a week so it feels fresher  but i might not be able to   3 viewings  9 2 2021  9 5 2021  9 22 2021 ,Watch this in IMAX     The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio  You re watching about 70  of the image on normal screens  plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers  I promise  it s worth it  WOWOWOWOWOW  This movie blew me away  I love it  A LOT  From beginning to end  Everything  I walked out of the movie so hyped  silent screaming under my mask as i walked to the car  It s been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy  I have so much to say   I love the MCU  a lot   but there are a few things that are frequently lacking  One of them is good fight scenes  They always have awesome action scenes  but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good  only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier  And in general  fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema  Ip man  The Raid Redemption  anything Jackie Chan    The fight scenes in this movie     how do i describe it    amazing martial arts that s fast but clear  filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts  against stunningly beautiful backdrops    phenomenal  And they continuously focus

Future of the MCU,"Shang Chi was nowhere near the top of my most anticipated MCU films over the years but it just about surprised me more than any of their films to date. Loaded with pulse pounding action (most in camera for once), a friendship turned possible romance you genuinely care about, and a lead that you can absolutely see taking the place of someone like Chris Evans as the ""face"" of the MCU for years to come. What an absolutely brilliant work of art.

Mandarin's also a language,"This movie features the lesser known Marvel superhero Shang-Chi, who's a former assassin from China hiding out in the USA. He goes back to China when assassins come after him, who are also after his sister. It turns out his father is the real Mandarin who sadly doesn't get to meet Iron Man. His impersonator from ""Iron Man 3"", played by Ben Kingsley is there and is a lot of fun. It's a nice throwback to the older Marvel films and a good way to satisfy the fans. I like how there's two people of the same gender who are not love interests.

We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. It's still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures. It truly is a unique film to have a mostly all-Asian cast in a superhero movie. I recall an interview when the actor said a lot of Chinese people are called Bruce Lee. That makes the documentary ""The Problem With Apu"" even more idiotic. ***1/2.",This movie features the lesser known Marvel superhero Shang Chi  who s a former assassin from China hiding out in the

"""Stay in the pocket"" I loved this more than expected to","Daniel Destin Cretton created a tranquil really well filmed marvel story driven fun time!

Masterpiece...,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu. He has to face his past involving him with the Ten Rings organization and crate his future accordingly.

I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it's an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh's who played as Ying Nan, Meng'er Zhang's who played as Xialing and Awkwafina's who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of Marvel.", Shang Chi and the Legend

"Epic, stunning, and a strong powerhouse story.","5 out of 5 stars.

Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.

Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.

The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.

The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.

There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.

I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.",5 out of 5 stars   Shang Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the

A Marvel-ous martial arts joy,"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.

Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.

Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.

Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.

If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.

Final Say -

Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.

Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) : Brief Review -

Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.

RATING - 7/10*

8 Rings out of 10,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.

Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.

If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.

It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff.",For the first time in a couple of years  since 2019 s  Captain Marvel  the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero  Simu Liu who  rather impressively  first asked for the role on

Promises good things for MCU's Phase Four,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.

I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film. There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.

Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.

One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.

Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.

All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear.

The Master of kung fu was really good but not as good as I wanted it to be.,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)

In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.

I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.

They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.

Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).

The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fu

Its a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu.",It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window  More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie  Shang Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to

Finally a new kind of marvel story,,,,,,,,
Marvel continues to be ambitious despite some faults,"Eluding his difficult past, a young man from China has been content playing it safe in San Francisco for the past several years even though he lacks a true sense of self. But when drastic circumstances draw him back to his conspicuous origins, he has no choice but to face his demons head on. Continuing to expand its cultural horizon the MCU's first Asian-centric movie has unique choreography, a dazzling visual scheme, splendid hand-to-hand combat, and of course the expected teases going forward, but some of the more elaborate action set pieces lack needed tension, much of the exposition and backstory isn't very engaging, and up until the third act many of the emotional aspects of the narrative aren't as rich or compelling as they could be. Some of the humor is strained, but it's efficiently cast and provides enough to be a distinctive entry into the Marvel world. **½",Eluding his difficult past  a young man from China has been content

This movie is way better than it should be and is a worthwhile addition to the marvel universe,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched at the theatre. The storyline for this movie follows a young man and his best friend who work as parking attendants and are one day attacked by super villains. As they dig into the young man's past they discover his father is behind the attack with the purpose of hopefully brining his family back together. This movie is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton (Just Mercy) and stars Simu Liu (Blood and Water), Tony Chiu-Wai Leung (Infernal Affairs), Ben Kingsley (Iron Man 3), Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians). The storyline for this movie is way better than it should be and has crazy depth around all of the characters. You really understand the what, when and why behind every circumstance and perspective. The acting is outstanding and the characters are perfectly portrayed. The special effects are awesome both in terms of the action scenes and backdrops. The dragons may have been a bit overdone; but other than that, A++++. The choreography was also excellent and seeing Yeoh in this really made me smile. This movie is way better than it should be and is a worthwhile addition to the marvel universe. I'd strongly recommend it. I'd score this a solid 8/10.",Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings  2021  is a movie my wife and I recently watched at the theatre  The storyline for this movie follows a young man and his best

A Great New Film in the MCU,"The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.

Main Character Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.

Supporting Characters Awkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.

Story The story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.

Script The script is okay, the drama is really well done and made me care about these characters and the emotional predicaments that they are put in during this adventure and I actually think this film is held back a little bit by the fact that it is in the MCU. What I mean by that is that it has the humour you come to expect from the universe is here but it is done poorly and I never really laughed at all and that was a disappointment.

Style The film looks fantastic, the CGI is all beautiful and I think it does an excellent job of building this world of Martial arts that is very different to other elements of the MCU. The fight scenes live up to the hype and are the best that have been seen in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, the flow so well and are so hard hitting that it is easily the best element of the film.

Overall Overall, Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is a great film and another solid addition to The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It isn't top tier Marvel but does a great job of introducing a new hero in Shang-Chi.",The next instalment of the MCU  Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it

Wonderful action packed fantasy adventure is brilliantly bought to life by a great cast and some great action sequences including some staggeringly beautiful fantasy scenes. Extraordinary how this almost child like fantasy film can so successfully bridge a chase scene across modern day San Francisco with battles with dragons whilst maintaining a goodly degree of drama snd humour.

Marvel movie by the numbers with beautiful dragons and charming locations,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.

The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.

This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.

The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.

The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.

However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.

Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.

At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon

A great adventure,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: The origin story of Shang Chi, his father Xu Wenwu found the Ten Rings of power 1,000 years ago and trough history has been a conqueror and Robber Baron. In 1996 he found Ta Lo a mystical village, but is beaten by it's guardian. Ying Li. They fall in love and have two children, Shang Li and his sister Xiang. Tragedy strikes and Shang Chi is raised to be an assassin, his sister trains in secret. The story is about Xu wanting his children to join with him in a strange quest but things don't go smoothly. Modern style gin battles and those involving mystical weapons abound, well choreographed as are the martial arts sequnces. One great fight aboard a runaway San Francisco bus on those hills. We also have a Cthuluesque devourer of souls with it's flying minions who battle a Chinese Flying Dragon (he's the good guy). There's also a faceless ""winged wombat"" and other mythological beasts. A great adventure.

COULD'VE BEEN BETTER...!,"The current MCU effort is truly a slight one as it swings for the fences to do what Black Panther did for all inclusive audiences by presenting an African superhero now we have a candidate, of the Asian persuasion, hoping for a repeat. Filling in the backstory of the rings (first introduced way back in the first Iron Man) which star Tony Leung has wielded for about 1000 years, which are a means of gaining power but when Leung wants to conquer a revered village in a remote forest, he meets his match & love which quells his desire to dominate fathering a pair of offspring (a boy & girl) as icing on the cake. Years later we find the scion, now played Simu Liu, living in the States working as a valet attendant w/his best friend, played by Awkwafina. When on a bus ride some men accost Lung for his jade pendant, his fighting prowess presents itself & fearing his sister is in similar straits (a cryptic postcard he received from her makes him think so), off he goes back to the bosom of Leung's fortress where he reveals their long dead mother may still be alive being held captive by the same residents of the Shangri-La he wanted to subjugate years before setting up a massive battle between Leung's forces & benevolent group of villagers who know the voice of Leung's wife is actually a captive dragon trickster hoping to be unleashed in order to feed on the souls of the nearby populace. So far so good, right? Wrong. Why did the usual craft & polish Disney's output come up short here? Lackluster lead, check, hackneyed story w/vague intimations of Asian legends & so forth, check (they do realize this comic book character was created by a couple of white guys!) & a third act replete w/motion & color to entice the viewers into thinking something more important is going on when the truth is, it isn't, check again. Didn't Disney fail to realize this was to be their third Asian inflected release in a year (after the live action Mulan remake & Raya & the Last Dragon animated feature, which also featured Awkwafina's vocal talents) so some of the story-lines would begin to cross pollinate & dilute each other until the final result would look like so much of a hodgepodge? I hate to be the dissenting opinion here but I would've rather have seen a big screen treatment of Iron Fist over this, apologies. Also starring Benedict Wong reprising his Wong character, Yuen Wah from Kung Fu Hustle as an archery elder, Michelle Yeoh as Liu's aunt & Zach Cherry (in his second incarnation in the MCU, he played

"A fun time at the movies, and that's all it really needed to be","Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.

My Rating: 8.6/10.",Charming and incredibly fun  Shang Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer  but it is one of their better films in some time  My main problems with the film lie in the

At a Time Where Asian Americans at Front and Center,,,,,,,,
Incredible MCU origin story,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways. It's definitely the best thing in phase 4 so far even if it's third act has some of the usual MCU problems.

Simu Liu gives an incredible and extremely charismatic lead performance whilst also having superb chemistry with Awkwafina, who is also incredible. Michelle Yeoh and Meng'er Zhang are both great and Tony Leung is amazing as one of the better villains in the MCU with plenty of backstory and depth.

Destin Daniel Cretton's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and stylish with some of the best action sequences in the franchise. The fight choreography is extremely impressive and the CG is mostly strong. It's well paced and both the soundtrack and the music by Joel P. West are both fantastic.",Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that s epic  emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in

"Not Quite a Ten, But Very Good Ring to Add To the Collection","Likes

Great Pacing: Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.

Character Development: The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.

The Surprise Cameo: Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.

The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.

The CGI Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.

The Acting: A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.

The Comedy: Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.

The Action: My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action exposé. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.

A Bit More Adult: The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.

Some of the political moments: While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.

A Little More Action:

The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.

The VERDICT:

Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:

Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.",Likes  Great Pacing  Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series

so far into the movie series  With all the information  there might be worry of the pace being off  but surprisingly it is done super well  Never really dragging  but not moving a blinding pace  mostly   Shang Chi s combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters  The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories  piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle  and not sacrifice on the action to come   Character Development  The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film  and in a sense they would be right  However  the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past  Shang s life is complicated and torn between light and dark  his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist  Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group  and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe   The Surprise Cameo  Can t say much without spoiling  but if you are like me  then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film  Several questions are answered with this character s return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans  The inclusion of this character also holds an important  albeit stretch  plot element to give a little more meaning behind it  and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture   The Cultural Influence  Like Black Panther and the African Culture  Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie  The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire  bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits  Concepts of family honor  the customs to practicing Marshal Arts  and the honoring of family are well integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick  The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel  and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history  I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale  and though again a little predictable and flaunting  really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others   The CGI Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do  Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves  Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed  the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements  and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects   The Acting  A great part played by all members on this film  extras included  Shang Chi s cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well  Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic  and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results  He holds much of the prodigal martial artist  disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style  However  he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum  Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays  but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past  I loved how well she was used in this film  and how great she complemented Simu in this role  Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character  once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist  and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi  So many other great actors and actresses in this film  but due to time restrictions I have to move on  but trust me they did well in their performances   The Comedy  Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh  and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly  However  Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice  Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs  with well timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy  There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place  but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up  And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie  It s all done so well and I was very happy with the results   The Action  My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies  Shang Chi delivered very well on this film s action expos   The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture  and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema  It s exciting  it s dynamic  and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect  Used well in the story  there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking  Even more so  the strategies behind them and what is required to win  accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era  so well done on that too   A Bit More Adult  The movie is definitely showing Marvel s modernization into the st century  and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments  Cursing is definitely increased in this one  with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue  but not to the point of being overdone  No F bombs  but some of the language has got a little more bite  so caution  In addition  the tone of the tale is darker  and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor  Captain America  and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale  which again is a plus   Some of the political moments  While nowhere as bad as   of movies today  Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film  Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating   Look what I had to do   was a bit of showboating that I could have done without  Yet even this dislike is marginal  given it s very little occurring  has some nice moments that build off of it  and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in   A Little More Action   The action in this movie is great  and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film  and things I was not expecting  Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced  namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought  However  the fights at the end needed some more time for me  and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time  Star Wars has done this successfully in the past  showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle  Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films  but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt  The battle is lengthy enough  I ll agree to that  but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me   The VERDICT   Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago  A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation  this hero s quest had all the makings of a fun  exciting and swift adventure we were expecting  Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects  was a deeper movie than I had expected  using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose  Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie  and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book  though again caution with your little ones watching it  As for limitations  I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie  but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me  Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them  Overall

Most Mystical and Beautiful Movie In History!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.

The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.

This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat. Trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge. By the end of the movie, I wanted to sing the song ""Hotel California"" at the top of my lungs.

This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother's village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.

I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 plus adults. It is available only in theaters September 3, 2021.

Perfect,"Honestly, on all levels this movie excels! The casting is perfect. The world building is creative, beautiful and faithful to its Asian roots. The CGI and location shoots are breathtaking. The fighting is the best I've ever seen and even the training ground sequences have an exquisite grace. The action was balanced by heart. I was concerned Awkwafina would take the humour to campy lows but she truly showed she has some serious dramatic chops. She was not the comic relief! They gave that honour to the Shakespearean stage giant, Ben Kingsley, Our own, homegrown 🇨🇦 Simu Liu was perfect for the part and his performance was world class. I could go on raving but I'll conclude my feedback by saying that this is in every way as powerful a MCU solo representation of Asian culture as BLACK PANTHER was for African culture. I gathered some feedback as I left the theatre, and got ratings of 7.5 (felt it needed more MCU content), 8 (saw many of the things I have just commented on). I've read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy, but I didn't find it so. For me it was more like chapters in a book, completely working together to create a world of content and design. Upon leaving the cinema, I was going to give the movie a 9 (superb) out of 10, but after reflecting on it, I don't know what they could have done to make it better, so, I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",Honestly  on all levels this movie excels  The casting is perfect  The world building is creative  beautiful and faithful to its Asian roots  The CGI and

needed more MCU content     saw many of the things I have just commented on   I ve read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy  but I didn t find it so  For me it was more like chapters in a book  completely working together to create a world of content and design  Upon leaving the cinema  I was going to give the movie a   superb  out of   but after reflecting on it  I don t know what they could have done to make it better  so  I give this film a   perfect  out of    Superhero Action Adventure ,Honestly levels movie excels The casting perfect The world building creative beautiful faithful Asian roots The CGI location shoots breathtaking The fighting best I ever seen even training ground sequences exquisite grace The action balanced heart I concerned Awkwafina would take humour

"Very Very Good Fun, A Great Origin Story!","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)

Well what a pleasant surprise, very much in the style of Black Panther, this origin story was really great from start to finish.

I saw this at the 3D 4DX at the O2 and we were thrown about, blown on, rained on and every other sensation at every turn it was fab-u-lus!

We had some great acting some great humour and plenty of ""magic"", for Marvel fans after the lacklustre Black Widow, the disaster of the Winter Soldier. Two goodens in a row what with Snake Eyes!

The fight scenes we well worked through and the opening bus sequence was very memorable. I don't thing there was anything I didn't like about this movie so I'm giving 10 outta 10.",Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings  2021   Well what a pleasant surprise  very much in the style of Black Panther  this origin story was really great from start to finish   I saw this at the 3D 4DX at the O2 and we were thrown about  blown on  rained on and every other sensation at every turn it was fab u lus   We had some great acting some great humour and plenty of  magic   for Marvel fans after the lacklustre Black Widow  the disaster of the Winter Soldier  Two goodens in a row what with Snake Eyes   The fight scenes we well worked through and the opening bus sequence was very memorable  I don t thing there was anything I didn t like about this movie so I m giving 10 outta 10 ,Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings  2021   Well what a pleasant surprise  very much in the style of Black Panther  this origin story was really great from start to finish   I saw this at the 3D 4DX at the O2 and we were thrown about  blown on  rained on and every other sensation at every turn it was fab u lus   We had some great acting some great humour and plenty of  magic   for Marvel fans after the lacklustre Black Widow  the disaster of the Winter Soldier  Two goodens in a row what with Snake Eyes   The fight scenes we well worked through and the opening bus sequence was very memorable  I don t thing there was anything I didn t like about this movie so I m giving 10 outta 10 ,Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings     Well what a pleasant surprise  very much in the style of Black Panther  this origin story was really great from start to finish   I saw this at the D DX at the O and we were thrown about  blown on  rained on and every other sensation at every turn it was fab u lus   We had some great acting some great humour and plenty of  magic   for Marvel fans after the lacklustre Black Widow  the disaster of the Winter Soldier  Two goodens in a row what with Snake Eyes   The fight scenes we well worked through and the opening bus sequence was very memorable  I don t thing there was anything I didn t like about this movie so I m giving  outta  ,Shang Chi Legend Ten Rings Well pleasant surprise much style Black Panther origin story really great start finish I saw D DX O thrown blown rained every sensation every turn fab u lus We great acting great humour plenty magic Marvel fans lacklustre Black Widow disaster Winter Soldier Two goodens row Snake Eyes The fight scenes well worked opening bus sequence memorable I thing anything I like movie I giving outta,shang chi legend ten rings well pleasant surprise much style black panther origin story really great start finish i saw d dx o thrown blown rained every sensation every turn fab u lus we great acting great humour plenty magic marvel fans lacklustre black widow disaster winter soldier two goodens row snake eyes the fight scenes well worked opening bus sequence memorable i thing anything i like movie i giving outta,s h a n g   c h i   l e g e n d   t e n   r i n g s   w e l l   p l e a s a n t   s u r p r i s e   m u c h   s t y l e   b l a c k   p a n t h e r   o r i g i n   s t o r y   r e a l l y   g r e a t   s t a r t   f i n i s h   i   s a w   d   d x   o   t h r o w n   b l o w n   r a i n e d   e v e r y   s e n s a t i o n   e v e r y   t u r n   f a b   u   l u s   w e   g r e a t   a c t i n g   g r e a t   h u m o u r   p l e n t y   m a g i c   m a r v e l   f a n s   l a c k l u s t r e   b l a c k   w i d o w   d i s a s t e r   w i n t e r   s o l d i e r   t w o   g o o d e n s   r o w   s n a k e   e y e s   t h e   f i g h t   s c e n e s   w e l l   w o r k e d   o p e n i n g   b u s   s e q u e n c e   m e m o r a b l e   i   t h i n g   a n y t h i n g   i   l i k e   m o v i e   i   g i v i n g   o u t t a,s h a n g c h i l e g e n d t e n r i n g s w e l l p l e a s a n t s u r p r i s e m u c h s t y l e b l a c k p a n t h e r o r i g i n s t o r y r e a l l y g r e a t s t a r t f i n i s h i s a w d d x o t h r o w n b l o w n r a i n e d e v e r y s e n s a t i o n e v e r y t u r n f a b u l u s w e g r e a t a c t i n g g r e a t h u m o u r p l e n t y m a g i c m a r v e l f a n s l a c k l u s t r e b l a c k w i d o w d i s a s t e r w i n t e r s o l d i e r t w o g o o d e n s r o w s n a k e e y e s t h e f i g h t s c e n e s w e l l w o r k e d o p e n i n g b u s s e q u e n c e m e m o r a b l e i t h i n g a n y t h i n g i l i k e m o v i e i g i v i n g o u t t a
Marvel's answer to Shonen Jump.,"Shang Chi is Marvel's latest blockbuster to grace the movies: and after 2020's non-existent Marvel slate, it was about bloody time we got something after the world dealt with the sars-variant and got our double shots. And now, late 2021 we can finally go back to the movies en masse, though the road to recovery's far from over.

Shang Chi is part-origin-story for a character we've never known before, part-CG-spectacle interlaced with nice kung-fu choreography in between, all in-universe expansion for Marvel's cinematic ambitions. And it makes you wonder how deeply they thought about paying reverence to everything from Bruce Lee to the Matrix, to Dragon Ball, The Last Airbender and Kung Fu Panda.

Marvel is doing its best to escape the confines of Iron Man's legacy, and this seems like an earnest start for something far-removed from the likes of Spider-Man, and so on. Also makes you wonder if Awkwafina is gonna become a major player outside the Shang Chi movies alone.

Shang Chi is the stuff you've come to expect from Marvel Studios; it's going big and it won't stop with every subsequent film here onward. Though bigger and better seems better fitted for high-concept space operas like Infinity War and Endgame than more earthbound character-driven stories.

"More movies like this, please, Marvel","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.

The action's great, and there's also so much of it- I liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by MCU standards, with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really CGI heavy).

The humour's also more consistent than most Marvel films, with most of the jokes landing. Also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures- they were all pretty inventive and well-executed.

I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable.",Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision  which

"Could be better, still enjoyable","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge. That particular film was such a perfect finale for the series that I have struggled with the efforts to get the storyline going again. It doesn't help that they have been so scattered in topics, lacking a single core group to bring them all together. Shang-Chi is another random hero that I only knew vaguely from references in the comics, but I never read any of his books back when I was a collector. I appreciated that this film brought a new style to a MCU movie. The blending of Wuxia into a superhero story was a fun choice.

There were also quite a few great actors in this film including Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh, and I'd even include Awkwafina in that category. I can certainly see how some other people might struggle with Awkwafina's schtick, but I find her comedic timing to be great, and I was laughing along the whole time. However, the one major name I left out of the ""great actors"" is Simu Liu. Sadly, I found him a little bland. He was okay with the comedy, but I certainly don't see him stacking up with the legends that have come before in the MCU. Heck, Benedict Wong has only about 5 minutes of screentime in this film, but still made a greater impression on me than Simu Liu.

Digging into the story of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I'd say it's a fine origin story, even if it was highly predictable. This is the kind of movie where you can stay 10 steps ahead of it, and that is unfortunate. I think that's the biggest problem with the entire film, while it's fun and engaging it also feels like a rough carbon copy of things that came before. It's a movie that is emulating a number of Wuxia films from the past, but it's not as good as any of them. It's a movie that is following the tropes of a superhero origin story, and once again isn't on the level of the best of the genre. You can't fault their ambition, but their execution was lacking.

All that negativity is not to say that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed the entire time in the theater, and was genuinely invested in the story. I thought it handled the links to the MCU well, but without feeling like it had shameless pandering for the fans, or devolving into obscure references only people like myself would understand. The film had some gorgeous visuals, and created its own world in a way that managed to be both unique but still consistent with the style of other MCU movies. There were personal stakes in the film, despite the fact that the ending fell into a giant CGI battle that felt unnecessary. I can't say that Shang-Chi will rise into the upper echelon of my MCU rankings, but it's better than some that came before.",As a MCU fanatic  I ve been trying to get excited about the movies they

That's a weird horse!,"WoW!!! Spectacular viewing from the MCU!

Sean (Shang-Chi) lives in San Francisco and parks cars for a living with his best friend Katy, whom he met when they were 14. He's happy with his life. He enjoys karaoke.

One day these bad, scary looking guys attack Sean and Katy on a bus and demand the green pendant Sean wears around his neck,,,

Oh yeah,,, Sean's real name is Shang-Chi, and his father is the leader of the TEN RINGS terrorist organization. What?!?!?!?!?!?

The visuals are incredible, and Awkwafina is hilarious!

Questionable script (and Awkwafina is just the worst),"The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times, because the plot needs them to do it. There are a bunch of unneeded ""deux-ex machina"" or conveniences because the writers trapped themselves into corners for no reason (that's what happens when you get the 2021 ""Mortal Kombat"", ""WW84"" and ""The Expendables"" writers).

Also, we have Awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst ""acting"" I've ever seen and a same type of joke (""awkward nonsense"") over and over, from start to finish, with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief.

But... Liu is actually pretty good as a lead (and his character is potentially great), and the ""Shang-Chi world"" is beautiful and it has everything to be super fun to watch in the future...without Awkwafine and better writers.",The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times  because the plot needs them to do it  There are a bunch of unneeded

See Shang-Chi on the Big Screen,"The new Marvel Super Hero film, SHANG-CHI and the LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton (JUST MERCY) has crafted a film that earns that statement.

Based on the Marvel comic book character (of course), SHANG-CHI tells the tale of...well...Shang-Chi a financially struggling - but happy - Valet in San Francisco who has a family secret.

Writer/Director Cretton has crafted a whimsical, mythological, mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe family of films.

At the center, newcomer Simu Liu (KIM'S CONVENIENCE) more than holds his own as the newest Super Hero in the MCU. He is grounded, centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets. He is a worthy addition to this world of Superheroes.

Joining him is the remarkable Awkwafina (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as his best friend, sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb. This film makes some smart choices with this character and Awkwafina shines.

The rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from Tony Chi-Wai Leung (as Shang-Chi's father) to Meng'er Zhang (as Shang-Chi's sister) and good ol' Michelle Yeoh (as Shang-Chi's Aunt) bring strong characters to life. They all shine.

This film also brings back a character from a previous MCU film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance. I won't spoil it by saying who it is, but I liked what the MCU did with this character.

But, this being a Marvel movie, all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action, action and more action - and something else, something mystical.

Here is where Director Cretton really shines. The action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well. The first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well.

This film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in Cretton's hands, this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane. I bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable, fantastical creatures.

To be honest, the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch, but this movie did what it needed it to do, it opened up a whole new area of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - in both character and locations - and I am anxious to see where they go from here.

Try to see SHANG-CHI on the Big Screen, the visuals are worth it.

Letter Grade A- (the finale needed to be better)

Ten Rings to rule them all...,"Positives:
This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.


The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.






Negatives:






Timeline?: So, it took more of a Marvel nerd than I am (my wonderful daughter-in-law Bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the ""Present Day"", the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" actually happen in 2023. So in the Marvel timeline, this is set in between Thanos's ""blip"" and ""the return"". This is the reason why Wong is present but not Doctor Strange, for example.

Summary Thoughts: Marvel goes East! This is a really entertaining addition to the franchise, mixing Marvel action with Eastern mysticism and martial arts. It's an impressive job by director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton, in only his second feature (he did ""Just Mercy"" in 2019).

As a Marvel film, there are of course end-credit scenes (""monkeys"" in onemannsmovies speak). A mid-title one is the best, bringing some additional Marvel characters into the mix. And there's a post-credits one which sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating.

It's ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market - the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue - might not get a release in China. According to this report, this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past, and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi's father is Fu Manchu - a Western-derived character with racial overtones.

This doesn't seem to have hurt it so far. After less than two weeks of opening, it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150-200 million.

sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating   It s ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market   the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue   might not get a release in China  According to this report  this appears to be for two reasons  firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past  and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi s father is Fu Manchu   a Western derived character with racial overtones   This doesn t seem to have hurt it so far  After less than two weeks of opening  it has made   million on a budget estimated to be    million    For the full graphical review and video check out  onemannsmovies on the web  Facebook and Tiktok  Thanks  ,Positives This Marvel best A

Marks a bland start to the new phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe,"Destin Daniel Cretton's 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' marks a bland start to the new phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography, but the film misses a solid storyline for an origin story as its titular character lacks personality and does not go through any heroic transformation story arc.

A Very Fresh MCU Entry,"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).

After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.

Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.

There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.

Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it.",When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008  there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting  but obviously  nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers  Endgame at the time  Along the way  unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms  I was really hoping that Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps  and it more than does  With rich world building  a great cast  and the use of mythology  this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date  Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more  After a first viewing  here s why Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen  if you can    After being trained as an assassin by his father  Shang Chi  Simu Liu  is given ten years of freedom from this life  In the present  the film picks up with Shang Chi  Shaun  as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy  Awkwafina   When the history mythology of the so called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront  his mission is to go and find his father  With the help of his friend and sister  they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world  From start to finish  this film delves into the fun  the mythological  the family drama  and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story   Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role  it s the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe  Yes  it still has the same look and feel  especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief  but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat  Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me  Not only does it feel simultaneous that they re trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature  but the fact that martial arts  mixed with actual god like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film  Without giving anything away  Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting  but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it   There s really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about  but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology  sometimes the comedy felt out of place  Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well  but I think certain cuts to her one liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation  There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention  but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier  Aside from the humour taking me out a few times  this film is just a blast   Overall  Shang Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole  Director Destin Daniel Cretton  Short Term 12  Just Mercy  has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope  The Matrix  Baby Driver  was also a real standout  I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that s absolutely in part to how it was filmed  I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative  but again  after thinking about the movie again  there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned  even if a tad overblown  If you re a fan of

Overhype,"Shang-chi, the most disloyal man in MCU: he has 10 rings for 10 wives.

Phase 4 continues with a new blockbuster with an all main Asian cast. Having escaped from his father, Shang-chi was forced to face his past and embrace his true self.

Is this movie good? The answer should be no, despite how much people overhyped this. However, I did enjoy the fight choreography and beautiful visuals. This honestly doesn't mean a lot, considering that this is a Marvel's project. The cast did an okay job themselves, and some comedic moments land.

If you actually take this movie seriously and don't get distracted by all the colors and actions on the screen, it should be clear that this was an overhyped, mediocre at best Marvel movie. It's not bad like Captain Marvel, but it's not good. There is barely any depth to the story. This type of story was done like a gazillion times, and this movie didn't add a lot into the tropes. The progression was formulaic, and you already know what the end would look like from the beginning.

Our main character, Shang-chi, again, was typical and bland. The actor wasn't necessarily bad, it's just that the writers didn't try hard enough to make the character more compelling or special. Also, the dude just randomly knew how to crazy stuff near the end, despite never wear the ten rings himself before.

Also, in typical Marvel fashion, the phenomenon of ""OH I know that person from somewhere else"" (*insert Leonardo DiCarpio's pointing meme*) was used as another distractor. Sometimes it's good and all, but remember that this made no impact on how good a movie is.

Which directs your attention to the post-credit scenes. Again, another overhype train from people. Reality is: they aren't that special.

Overall, just calm down people. A mediocre Marvel hero movie. Doesn't mean it's a bad movie. 6.5/10.",Shang chi  the most disloyal man in MCU  he has 10 rings for 10 wives   Phase 4 continues with a new blockbuster with an all main Asian cast  Having escaped

Best action-movie I've seen all summer!,,,,,,,,
Ten rings,"I really had fun with this new Marvel movie, I didn't know who Shang-Chi was but I did my research on the character and went in on what I learned.

Simu liu was awesome as Shang-Chi and played the character amazingly, Awkwafina was pretty funny and likable.

The fight scenes and stunts were all really well choreographed and really cool seeing.

I really liked the villain and the connection to the hero and the final fight. I found it amazing.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire MCU! Destin Daniel Cretton delivers an entertainment-heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe.

Elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is the second film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Starring Simu Liu, Tony Leung, and Awkwafina, it elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture.

In San Francisco, Shaun (Simu Liu) works as a parking valet along with his close friend Katy (Awkwafina). Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun is hiding important secrets from her - he is in fact a skilled martial artist whose real name is Shang-Chi and he has run away from his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), the leader of the powerful Ten Rings organisation. After some Ten Rings members attack the pair of them on a bus, Shang-Chi discovers that they have stolen a valuable pendant given to him by his mother Li (Fala Chen) before he left for the United States. Shang-Chi grows concerned that the Ten Rings' next target will be the pendant belonging to his younger sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), and so along with Katy he sets off to look for her before the gang can locate her first.

Now that the Infinity Saga has concluded, the time has come for some new heroes to enter the MCU. Of course, there are so many to choose from, considering the large roster of characters that have come into existence over the last several decades. Although Shang-Chi wasn't the first one to come to my mind when predicting who would lead the charge of fresh faces into Phase Four, his debut big screen outing ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" successfully cements him as a memorable hero just as worthy as any other past Avenger.

What I believe separates this film from the typical hero origin story is all of the interesting aspects of Asian culture it integrates into the story. I'm all for inclusivity in movies, so long as it isn't shoehorned in there for the sake of appeasing a political agenda, and here it succeeds greatly thanks to the wide array of Asian crew members who worked hard to ensure that virtually all customs are represented. The film never precisely establishes the place Shang-Chi's family is from (though it is hinted to be somewhere in mainland China), as they are seen observing various cultural traditions that don't quite narrow things down to one particular Asian country. For example, there are martial artists resembling Shaolin monks, who are supposed to be from China, seen using techniques from Japanese and Korean folklore. This has likely been done on purpose to ensure that all Asian audiences feel included, but never so much that it comes across as disrespectful. After previously bungling Asian-related matters with the terrible 2020 remake of ""Mulan"", ""Shang-Chi"" feels like an appropriate apology from Disney to all of their viewers.

At this stage, it feels pointless to complain about Marvel films following the exact same template when introducing new heroes so I won't hold that against this one too much. With that said, thanks to some brilliantly choreographed martial arts fight scenes and gorgeous visuals, director Destin Daniel Cretton (""Just Mercy"") has provided us with one of the most unique looking MCU films to date. One scene near the beginning features Xu Wenwu walking through a bright, beautiful oriental garden complete with bamboo reeds in the foreground. A short time later, he is locked in hand-to-hand combat with his future love interest Li. This reminded me of ""wuxia"" films, a popular subgenre of Chinese martial arts movies, like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". In fact, this scene was such a good tribute to that genre that I almost forgot this was a Marvel movie and was instead watching one of those classic Kung Fu films my dad used to show me when I was young. You know you've created something special when your film can appeal this effectively to fans of both Marvel and Kung Fu movies.

Considering the last thing I saw him in was the sitcom ""Kim's Convenience"", Simu Liu definitely took me by surprise as to how well cast he was as the film's main star. I was expecting him to be a wisecracking Americanised version of the Asian hero but he actually plays most of the film straight, only responding humorously when absolutely necessary. His dramatic side truly shines when he is interacting with his onscreen father Tony Leung. In fact, Leung's character Xu has one of the most tragic backstories of any character in the whole MCU, which I won't spoil here. Another surprise was Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's best friend Katy. Rather than being another typical love interest, Katy is instead a loyal platonic friend of his who is willing to help him out no matter how limited her knowledge on the field of battle may be. It also helps that she is responsible for most of the film's comic relief.

With a new superhero now officially introduced, it's safe to assume that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" has shown an optimistic future for the MCU. Its broad appeal to Eastern and Western audiences alike as well as the usual action-packed fun we've come to expect over the years makes it one of the best origin films to come out of the MCU to date. The Marvel hype train shows no signs of slowing down and if things keep going the way they are, it won't be stopping anytime soon.

Showcases the possibilities of Phase 4,"This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame. Finding new stories to tell within cultures rarely explored is the way for the MCU to continue to entertain.

The fights in the first third of this movie were absolutely brutal and quite innovative. I wish they hadn't front-loaded all of this stunning choreography since the fights later on paled in comparison. This film also contains arguably the most beautiful and artful scene in the MCU with the Crouching Tiger-inspired hidden garden duel. There was a sense of more indie-based filmmaking and I really enjoyed that fresh take on the genre. I would be remiss not to mention Tony Leung, who perfectly brings to life one of the finest villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and is one you can truly empathize with.

While there are still the tropes expected in a Marvel origin film, it succeeds pretty well for the most part. I wish the big CGI battle at the end had just been a personal fight between father and son, but alas. The humor, especially Awkwafina, was pretty hit or miss as well. The Trevor Slattery stuff was great though.

Shang-Chi is definitely one of the best origin films in the MCU and really stands out as a unique entry in the long-running series.",This was the right direction for Marvel to head post Endgame

Cool one,"Cool worlds/ten-rings VFX, OKayish plot, good characterisations.

But somehow somewhere it felt like the film was actually made for kids maybe because of the story being wholly dependent on the magical dragon.

Also, there could've been some heavy emotions & more action sequences & some twists/turns in the script to have more grip on the audience. Overall, it was a good watch but could've been still better.",Cool worlds ten rings VFX  OKayish plot  good characterisations   But somehow somewhere it felt like the film was actually made for kids maybe because of the story being wholly dependent on the magical dragon   Also  there could ve been some heavy emotions   more action sequences   some twists turns in the script to have more grip on the audience  Overall  it was a good watch but could ve been still better ,Cool worlds ten rings VFX  OKayish plot  good characterisations   But somehow somewhere it felt like the film was actually made for kids maybe because of the story being wholly dependent on the magical dragon   Also  there could ve been some heavy emotions   more action sequences   some twists turns in the script to have more grip on the audience  Overall  it was a good watch but could ve been still better ,Cool worlds ten rings VFX  OKayish plot  good characterisations   But somehow somewhere it felt like the film was actually made for kids maybe because of the story being wholly dependent on the magical dragon   Also  there could ve been some heavy emotions   more action sequences   some twists turns in the script to have more grip on the audience  Overall  it was a good watch but could ve been still better ,Cool worlds ten rings VFX OKayish plot good characterisations But somehow somewhere felt like film actually made kids maybe story wholly dependent magical dragon Also could heavy emotions action sequences twists turns script grip audience Overall good watch could still better,cool worlds ten rings vfx okayish plot good characterisations but somehow somewhere felt like film actually made kids maybe story wholly dependent magical dragon also could heavy emotions action sequences twists turns script grip audience overall good watch could still better,c o o l   w o r l d s   t e n   r i n g s   v f x   o k a y i s h   p l o t   g o o d   c h a r a c t e r i s a t i o n s   b u t   s o m e h o w   s o m e w h e r e   f e l t   l i k e   f i l m   a c t u a l l y   m a d e   k i d s   m a y b e   s t o r y   w h o l l y   d e p e n d e n t   m a g i c a l   d r a g o n   a l s o   c o u l d   h e a v y   e m o t i o n s   a c t i o n   s e q u e n c e s   t w i s t s   t u r n s   s c r i p t   g r i p   a u d i e n c e   o v e r a l l   g o o d   w a t c h   c o u l d   s t i l l   b e t t e r,c o o l w o r l d s t e n r i n g s v f x o k a y i s h p l o t g o o d c h a r a c t e r i s a t i o n s b u t s o m e h o w s o m e w h e r e f e l t l i k e f i l m a c t u a l l y m a d e k i d s m a y b e s t o r y w h o l l y d e p e n d e n t m a g i c a l d r a g o n a l s o c o u l d h e a v y e m o t i o n s a c t i o n s e q u e n c e s t w i s t s t u r n s s c r i p t g r i p a u d i e n c e o v e r a l l g o o d w a t c h c o u l d s t i l l b e t t e r
Shang-chi and the legend of the ten rings,"I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.

Disney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.

The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.

There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.

I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7

Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad.",I have just watched this movie  I am an avid Marvel fan  This film introduces a new character  there is that standard Disney approach  with a mix of comedy  seriousness and lots of action   Disney work through the numbers on this film  there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin   The acting is good  special effects are solids and the story is not bad   There s continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans   I would actually pitch this at 7 5 10  not quite an 8 but higher than a 7  Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark  this film is not that bad ,I have just watched this movie  I am an avid Marvel fan  This film introduces a new character  there is that standard Disney approach  with a mix of comedy  seriousness and lots of action   Disney work through the numbers on this film  there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin   The acting is good  special effects are solids and the story is not bad   There s continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans   I would actually pitch this at 7 5 10  not quite an 8 but higher than a 7  Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark  this film is not that bad ,I have just watched this movie  I am an avid Marvel fan  This film introduces a new character  there is that standard Disney approach  with a mix of comedy  seriousness and lots of action   Disney work through the numbers on this film  there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin   The acting is good  special effects are solids and the story is not bad   There s continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans   I would actually pitch this at     not quite an  but higher than a   Those review of  or  out of ten are way off the mark  this film is not that bad ,I watched movie I avid Marvel fan This film introduces new character standard Disney approach mix comedy seriousness lots action Disney work numbers film surprises tin The acting good special effects solids story bad There continuity linking marvel universe nice fans I would actually pitch quite higher Those review ten way mark film bad,i watched movie i avid marvel fan this film introduces new character standard disney approach mix comedy seriousness lots action disney work numbers film surprises tin the acting good special effects solids story bad there continuity linking marvel universe nice fans i would actually pitch quite higher those review ten way mark film bad,i   w a t c h e d   m o v i e   i   a v i d   m a r v e l   f a n   t h i s   f i l m   i n t r o d u c e s   n e w   c h a r a c t e r   s t a n d a r d   d i s n e y   a p p r o a c h   m i x   c o m e d y   s e r i o u s n e s s   l o t s   a c t i o n   d i s n e y   w o r k   n u m b e r s   f i l m   s u r p r i s e s   t i n   t h e   a c t i n g   g o o d   s p e c i a l   e f f e c t s   s o l i d s   s t o r y   b a d   t h e r e   c o n t i n u i t y   l i n k i n g   m a r v e l   u n i v e r s e   n i c e   f a n s   i   w o u l d   a c t u a l l y   p i t c h   q u i t e   h i g h e r   t h o s e   r e v i e w   t e n   w a y   m a r k   f i l m   b a d,i w a t c h e d m o v i e i a v i d m a r v e l f a n t h i s f i l m i n t r o d u c e s n e w c h a r a c t e r s t a n d a r d d i s n e y a p p r o a c h m i x c o m e d y s e r i o u s n e s s l o t s a c t i o n d i s n e y w o r k n u m b e r s f i l m s u r p r i s e s t i n t h e a c t i n g g o o d s p e c i a l e f f e c t s s o l i d s s t o r y b a d t h e r e c o n t i n u i t y l i n k i n g m a r v e l u n i v e r s e n i c e f a n s i w o u l d a c t u a l l y p i t c h q u i t e h i g h e r t h o s e r e v i e w t e n w a y m a r k f i l m b a d
There's Dragon Fights!,"What more do you want?

I honestly didn't want to like this film. As you may have read in previous reviews of the Marvel films, they are all dumb. And this one ends as they all do, with just massive CGI chaos. But did I mention they were dragons fighting?

Anyway, the film is fun. Fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life. The fight sequences are laborious...sometimes. Since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn't even crack a rib seems silly.

But Shang-Chi makes it work. Here played by the moon-faced wide-eyed and fun loving Simu Liu. And he does a wonderful job NOT wanting to be anything but a typical slacker. While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.

Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn't require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.

His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.

Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""Mulan""",What more do you want   I honestly didn t want to like this film  As you may have read in previous

Really enjoyable film 7/10,"Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him. Although I have a really deep criticism over fase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've decided to go watch the movie in theaters (after two years of being away from theaters due to covid). Overall I really enjoyed it. There were still a few moments that I regretted and that were dull. Not to mention ""little mistakes"" that Marvel keep doing with their movies. In general it was a fun experience. The plot didn't have much to offer to be honest: another origin story of a superhero that tries to run away from his fate and responsibilities. Until he is forced to face his past.

This has been the kind of way for Marvel to introduce their new characters in the MCU, I wished they would have been more creative but they do deliver creativity for once. Watching people speak their native language for once was a huge step up for Marvel. The movie is also influenced by many other asian classic films such as ""Hero"", ""Hidden Dragon"", ""Seven Samurai"" and ""In the mood for love"".

Of course it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without some end credits scenes (how original). The end credit scene does confirm the return of Shang Chi at some point, but what the end credits scene does confirm moreover is how the future Marvel films will all get connected. As I said before, I'm less optimistic with this whole fase 4 of Marvel but it wouldn't hurt or kill to watch a few of them. To me, I just wanted to return to the theaters.

Speaking of actors: Simu Liu is a fantastic actor and will definitely become a fan favorite, both him and his character. Awkwafina steals the show every single time she's on screen. Tony Leung is wonderful and acts so well. The whole cast is perfect. If you are in favor of theaters and Marvel movies than go watch Shang Chi.

P. S: the end credit song - Fire in the Sky by Anderson Paak. Is the best part of the movie.",Shang   Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him  Although I have a really deep criticism over fase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe  I ve

nothing out of this world but a lot better then i expected,,,,,,,,
An Asian Marvel Origin story with all the spectacle you've come to expect.,"Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot. The Asian style and presentation is beautiful, showing off plenty of folklore and style in both modern and traditional settings. The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting The plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more. The ending was pretty grand and epic, but I felt it could have been better.",Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format  but the formula works

Really good blend of martial arts and MCU formula,"The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU. Just for that scene alone, this movie deserves to be watched on the biggest screen possible. Shang Chi benefited from being a very unknown character and the movie gives him the opportunity to shine bright with his development. The story is really fast paced and even if the final act succumbs to the typical Marvel esque, it leaves you with a pretty solid good feeling while leaving the cinema. A really great MCU movie, a superb martial arts spectacle and a great step up for the Phase 4. Do not miss the two post credits scenes. The middle scene is exciting and the very last one is pretty intriguing.

Unique. But a very fun film,"I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this. And on the whole it was very enjoyable and fun to watch!

First instincts when watching were a little mixed. It was an odd start to say the least and didn't have any idea how this was going to go. And my first instincts on Katy were also mixed. I felt like they were trying to force the humour out on her and I found her character really annoying. HOWEVER..

Once it gets going the film gets better and better. Katy becomes a great character and all the characters development and arcs on a whole were truly phenomenal! For me the best part of the film was the characters and seeing them all develop throughout.

So is the plot good? To be blunt, yes! It's truly unique and uniquely done in so many ways, I don't want to give out anything that would spoil anything, but it's really not what you expect. That's all I say!



I'll shut up now! I'll just say it's well worth watching. It's a great ""superhero"" to have and a great one to watch. And overall it's a fun, visually pleasing and brilliant watch. I recommend.",I have to say I was looking forward to this one  First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this  And on the whole it was

Phase Four is in Full Swing!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had. It's easily the best Marvel movie post-Infinity Saga (I know, that's not exactly saying much), and is very promising for the quality of Marvel's next projects. We have probably the second best villain intimately tied to the origin of a new, entertaining, and capable hero full of potential, in a story that ties the universe together and teases upcoming events in tantalising and unexpected ways. The fight choreography was on point, the dialogue was seeped in cultural significance, the jokes all land, and the CGI is some of the best since Thanos himself. Shang-Chi is an all-out success for Marvel, it seems in multiple ways - both critically and financially. Really its only downfall is that at times this doesn't feel like that much of a movie about Shang-Chi himself purely because his origin is tied so closely to the story of the Ten Rings. Instead it's a Ten Rings movie featuring Shang-Chi, which is fine, but feels a bit weird for his introduction into the MCU. And yes, the Ten Rings are tied up with the Iron Man films perfectly, almost making the whole Aldrich Killian thing better in retrospect. I give Shang-Chi a high 8/10, with promise of moving up with rewatches.",Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had  It s easily the best Marvel movie post Infinity

Refreshing and Captivating!,"""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you? You walked in my shadow.""

Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings follows Shang-Chi, a seemingly ordinary young man from San Francisco who parks cars for a living alongside his friend, as must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization. Marvel took a big chance on this project. Of course we've had lesser known heroes end up getting their own movie franchise within the MCU, but Shang-Chi is not one many know about. Little was known going in other than we'd get some action scenes and explore new territory within the MCU. What they managed to do with Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is unlike any Marvel movie yet. Destin Daniel Cretton takes a new approach that works wonders. His previous works of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy are heartfelt dramas so something big like this is new territory, but he incorporates the same style and messages into this. The dysfunctional family dynamic serving as the character arc and forming the conflict is so much deeper than some random business guy who wants to rule the world. With this story, it's easy to connect with it and understand character motives. I will say there's a lot to pack in here and the story can get muddy at points, but it pulls itself together that we retain most of everything.

Simu Liu is fantastic in the title role. Previous to watching, I hadn't seen him in anything. But he has all the skills as an emerging actor to be a household name. Shang-Chi is an interesting character to follow. As he discovers and recalls moments from his upbringing, we can slowly piece him together. There's much more to be made from him, but with future installments we'll be able to get much more. And Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is perfectly cast as Xu Wenwu. He's a villain I can understand, like, and dislike all at the same time. He's flawed, but there's depth to him. And he almost steals the show by the end with another showcase of mad acting skills. But the character I've been thinking of a lot, and mainly because she was so hilarious, is Awkwafina as Katy. Awkwafina is one of my favorite actresses working right now, especially after her role in The Farewell, and she smashes this. Katy is the typical comedic sidekick but so much fun. One of the funniest jokes comes from her and I was laughing hysterically. Maybe more character will come from her later, but what we got was enough for me. I can't wait to see her again! I should also mention Meng'er Zhang as Xialing. This is her first role and she's also great. What they'll do with her next should be interesting.

From a technical standpoint, this is impressive for a Marvel movie. There are some stunning visuals. The cinematography isn't that gray color scheme used in most, though it does fall into that later on, and bursting with color. And as you probably know, the visual effects are as good as they come. It's not muddled with CGI and a scene that was completely green screen, which is nice to see. Also, Marvel has been doing great with the themes and score lately because this is another great one, along with the soundtrack. Paired with this are the best fight scenes out of the whole MCU. The stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at. The bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree. It's refreshing and captivating in every way. Marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!", I gave you ten years to live your life  And where did that get you  You

Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings - enjoyably unMarvellous film. 80%,"""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Many years ago I saw ""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" and found the fight scenes in that literally unbelievable a lot of the time. ""Shang-Chi"" often seems subtle in its fight scenes by comparison but then does have action sequences which are more like MCU superhero films. As an origin story, it assumes no familiarity with the MCU and in fact plays mostly as a non-MCU film, which is what I liked about it.

Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi/Shaun, the son of a mobster, Xu Wenwu (played by Tony Leung) who could quite easily have been the subject of a film or franchise himself, due to his legendary characteristics. Shang-Chi's mother Ying Li (played by Fala Chen) is also a legendary kind of character. This contrast of 'Eastern' legendary figures and 'Western' MCU legendary figures worked to the former's advantage, as the latter often come across as plastic toy figurines being used in a sandpit by small boys to play with.

The plot concerns how Shang-Chi/Shaun sought to move from under the shadow of his father to become his own man but just when he thought he was out, he is pulled back into Wenwu's orbit. The film mixes the seriousness, perhaps, of Chinese martial arts films with the jokey style of American Hollywood films. As should be expected from a MCU film, eventually the fate of the world will come into play and someone will have to play the hero to save it.

The martial arts in this film juxtaposes frenetic fight sequences with elegant and fluid fight scenes which have their own particular charm. Other times the action sequences seem lifted from a Disney live action family film and that was enjoyable too, if you just suspended disbelief.

Speaking of comedy, I found the earliest instance of this to be aiming very low for laughs, which isn't uncommon in MCU films but I warmed to later instances of it. For instance, I was amused by the character of a thespian who sounded like he was from Liverpool, when he reminisced about what he took from a film that he saw as a teenager and how that inspired him to get into acting. That actor playing the thespian did seem familiar, perhaps for his voice but I did recognise his name in the closing credits and remembered the role that he is perhaps best known for.

An interesting aspect to this film is its subject matter, i.e. An Asian superhero and a mostly Asian cast. Is this another attempt by Hollywood to crack the now important Chinese market? If it is, then the cooling relations between the US and China is an unwelcome fly in the ointment for Hollywood studios trying to make a lot of money from Chinese cinemagoers.

Another question that came into my mind was whether ""The Ten Rings"" is based on Chinese legend or is a Marvel appropriation of Chinese culture, tailored for 'Western' audiences that don't care about cultural authenticity. If it isn't the former, then I think that there could be a niche for films which mine authentic 'Eastern' legends and myths. That could be something which might interest me (Sinophiles would no doubt reel out a long list of films which have done just that!).

As you might have guessed, I wasn't the first in line to see this film. In fact, I wasn't even sure that I wanted to see it, as I haven't watched every line of superhero films in the MCU (maybe I should watch ""The Black Panther""?). As it stands, I think it was worth the punt in seeing it. I'd go so far as to say that seeing a sequel to this would be more appealing if it wasn't tied to The Avengers franchise! Furthermore, I would have liked this film not to remind that it was part of the MCU, which it managed to do, at least until the closing credits, which I didn't welcome when it made its first appearance. With that being said, this is the kind of film that you could watch again, after a suitable break. Although I didn't watch this film in 3D, it might be worth it to do so (as sometimes the extra cost of the ticket gives added value to the experience and...sometimes it doesn't).

Notes to self:

* The narrative did have some logical gaps in it, for example why Shang-Chi was attacked on the bus. What was that all about?

* The film was dedicated to the memory of Brad Allan, I think. Not sure who that was...searching now, a few websites list him as the supervising stunt coordinator.

* Reading the closing credits, I was reminded that this film was shot in Australia, which isn't obvious watching it, so, good job studio (I think I saw or heard something on ABC in Australia about how Asian Australians got to be in this film, perhaps a kung fu exponent or exponents)!

* My score for this film was tracking from 75% (7 out of 10 stars) to 75+% (8 out 10 stars) to just a flat 80% final score.", Shang Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings  is a superhero origin story

A wonderful addition to the MCU!,"Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package. It has lots of brilliant trademark MCU humour and tongue in cheek quips. It has exceptional action which I'll get into a bit more. It also has solid connections to the rest of the MCU, balanced well between being its own stand alone film but laying hints of how this is going to fit into the wider story of Phase 4.

I'll start with the action as this is what Shang-Chi is famed for. Quite simply it's awesome. It has the best hand to hand combat the MCU has seen, and sequences that are steeped in Chinese culture, with the rhythmic style of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon woven into the fabric of this film.

The cast was brilliant. Simu Liu was a fantastic lead, and I'd be happy to see him grow into a big player in the MCU. Awkwafina as expected was fantastic, adding so much effortless humour to the film.

What I really love about Shang-Chi is that it has a very well explored and interesting antagonist. This can't always be said for Marvel films as there have been a few phoned in villains, but Shang-Chi doesn't come close to falling into this trap. Tony Leung really sold his role and gave it a lot of power and emotion.

In terms of plot they did a fantastic job of introducing us to this pretty obscure character. There is a lot of exposition and plenty of flashbacks, perhaps too many but I appreciate they had a lot of background content to feed us so I can't grumble too much. I loved how the plot was so mystical and magical, very much feeling like an epic adventure.

Yet again Marvel Studios knocking it out of the park!",Shang Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package  It has lots of brilliant trademark MCU humour and tongue in cheek quips

Good,"One of the best origin MCU films. Good story, great and complex family relationships, with it's own identity, a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes. Between Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Tony Leung it's difficult to decide which was the best, but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to Ben Kingsley, always funny!). The best thing I can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an MCU film.

The negatives? Again, too much CGI. It's a huge problem with Marvel and Disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene. I like CGI but seriously, some scenes would look much better with practical effects, others would look way better if they just were shot at location.",One of the best origin MCU films  Good story

Sort of disappointed..,"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.

The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.

The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.

Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.

In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that.",I got to admit I wasn t particularly blown away by anything in the movie   I might even say  I was bored  by it   Don t get me wrong   it IS a spectacle  The action is

Destin Daniel Cretton; you've done it again!,"Marvel's latest feature introduces cinephiles to Shaun AKA Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) a martial arts master and a character created by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin, first appearing in a Marvel publication back in 1973. Beginning in the first of many gorgeously choreographed and shot sequences, we're introduced to Shang-Chi's father Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and mother Li (Fala Chen) also entailing the awesome power of the Ten Rings which Xu currently has in his possession. What follows is a heart-pounding and ridiculously entertaining adventure movie with true heart.

Filled with beautiful performances not least from everyone already mentioned and including Awkwafina as Shaun's best friends Katy and Meng'er Zhang as sister Xialing, there's plenty here to adore on screen not even getting to the truly awe-inspiring action set pieces with the best fight scenes I've seen in recent memory. Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) is very quickly becoming one of my favourite directors having produced three incredible pieces of cinema in the last 8 years. It's great to see that his passion for storytelling and independent spirit still shines through his latest here while also staying true to the Marvel fan base (I really did not expect a certain character to show up but made for some really comical moments).

The visual effects are of course stunning but what makes them stand out here are how they're incorporated with the beautiful landscapes to enhance the feeling of authentically experiencing Shaun's heritage and getting wrapped up in the culture that the filmmakers so wonderfully explore. This is how origin stories should be made! The creature design is also incredible and is an integral element to making the final sequences all the more breathtaking.

Visuals compensate for the lack of script depth,"One again the studio brings jokes and the dazzling visuals over a good character development. After one hour, you don't care for the characters. Dysfunctional drama in the family and the chosen one - we have seen this a million times.

This is the first time I felt sleepy for an action movie. I feel like i wasted my money, despite availing the Super Tuesday offer. The Suicide Squad was far much better in terms of storyboard.

"With Shang-Chi, Marvel presents their first Asian superhero in a good and cultural way.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy.

The film is about Shaun (Simu Liu), who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun, he is forced to confront his past after all. To do this, he must take his birth name Shang-Chi again, to protect Katy and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who is also Shaun. His father.

This film is Marvel's first superhero film starring an Asian actor. Furthermore, with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well. For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as an example. Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films. They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly. The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film. Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways.

At one point, the film also feels like you're watching a live-action mix of the Asian animation shows Pokémon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers. The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film. The visual effects are also put to good use in the film. Except for a few scenes, it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background, but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film. Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film. A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film.

The acting is well done by the film cast. Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part, with both parties quickly making a good deal. Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully. Along with Awkwafina, he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor. The comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film, which sometimes does happen. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way, so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me. This film is also only his first English-language role in an American film. Although this is only his first time, he still delivers good and appropriate acting. Meng'er Zhang does not get that much time in the film, but a bit less good or present in the film.",Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series  The

is not disturbing in the film  Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film  A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film   The acting is well done by the film cast  Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part  with both parties quickly making a good deal  Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully  Along with Awkwafina  he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor  The comedy also doesn t overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film  which sometimes does happen  Tony Chiu Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way  so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me  This film is also only his first English language role in an American film  Although this is only his first time  he still delivers good and appropriate acting  Meng er Zhang does not get that much time in the film  but a bit less good or present in the film ,Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series  The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton  the director of Short Term  and Just Mercy   The film is about Shaun  Simu Liu   who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy  Awkwafina   When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun  he is forced to confront his past after all  To do this  he must take his birth name Shang Chi again  to protect Katy and his sister Xialing  Meng er Zhang  from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin  Tony Chiu Wai Leung  who is also Shaun  His father   This film is Marvel s first superhero film starring an Asian actor  Furthermore  with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well  For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon as an example  Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films  They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly  The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film  Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways   At one point  the film also feels like you re watching a live action mix of the Asian animation shows Pok mon and Avatar  The Last Airbender  These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers  The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film  The

Mediocre film from Marvel,"Let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view. It depends a lot on the visual effects, its main characters can be funny but not nice, the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong, Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years. The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome. The rest is routine, mediocre, tiring and bland.",Let s agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view  It depends a lot on the visual effects  its main characters can be funny but not nice  the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong  Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years  The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome  The rest is routine  mediocre  tiring and bland ,Let s agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view  It depends a lot on the visual effects  its main characters can be funny but not nice  the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong  Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years  The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome  The rest is routine  mediocre  tiring and bland ,Let s agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view  It depends a lot on the visual effects  its main characters can be funny but not nice  the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong  Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years  The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome  The rest is routine  mediocre  tiring and bland ,Let agree bad movie multiple points view It depends lot visual effects main characters funny nice story generate much interest seen fights many times better way almost film produced Hong Kong Indonesia Thailand last twenty years The thing saves film karaoke scene unexpectedly welcome The rest routine mediocre tiring bland,let agree bad movie multiple points view it depends lot visual effects main characters funny nice story generate much interest seen fights many times better way almost film produced hong kong indonesia thailand last twenty years the thing saves film karaoke scene unexpectedly welcome the rest routine mediocre tiring bland,l e t   a g r e e   b a d   m o v i e   m u l t i p l e   p o i n t s   v i e w   i t   d e p e n d s   l o t   v i s u a l   e f f e c t s   m a i n   c h a r a c t e r s   f u n n y   n i c e   s t o r y   g e n e r a t e   m u c h   i n t e r e s t   s e e n   f i g h t s   m a n y   t i m e s   b e t t e r   w a y   a l m o s t   f i l m   p r o d u c e d   h o n g   k o n g   i n d o n e s i a   t h a i l a n d   l a s t   t w e n t y   y e a r s   t h e   t h i n g   s a v e s   f i l m   k a r a o k e   s c e n e   u n e x p e c t e d l y   w e l c o m e   t h e   r e s t   r o u t i n e   m e d i o c r e   t i r i n g   b l a n d,l e t a g r e e b a d m o v i e m u l t i p l e p o i n t s v i e w i t d e p e n d s l o t v i s u a l e f f e c t s m a i n c h a r a c t e r s f u n n y n i c e s t o r y g e n e r a t e m u c h i n t e r e s t s e e n f i g h t s m a n y t i m e s b e t t e r w a y a l m o s t f i l m p r o d u c e d h o n g k o n g i n d o n e s i a t h a i l a n d l a s t t w e n t y y e a r s t h e t h i n g s a v e s f i l m k a r a o k e s c e n e u n e x p e c t e d l y w e l c o m e t h e r e s t r o u t i n e m e d i o c r e t i r i n g b l a n d
Very good film with a novel concept,"I thought this film was a good break from the usual marvel super hero films, it was much more traditional martial arts film combined with some modern aspects.

The concept was good and the film went along at a great pace. There was some good humour as well.

I would really recommend it.",I thought this film was a good break from the usual marvel super hero films  it was much more traditional martial arts film combined with some modern aspects   The concept was good and the film went along at a great pace  There was some good humour as well   I would really recommend it ,I thought this film was a good break from the usual marvel super hero films  it was much more traditional martial arts film combined with some modern aspects   The concept was good and the film went along at a great pace  There was some good humour as well   I would really recommend it ,I thought this film was a good break from the usual marvel super hero films  it was much more traditional martial arts film combined with some modern aspects   The concept was good and the film went along at a great pace  There was some good humour as well   I would really recommend it ,I thought film good break usual marvel super hero films much traditional martial arts film combined modern aspects The concept good film went along great pace There good humour well I would really recommend,i thought film good break usual marvel super hero films much traditional martial arts film combined modern aspects the concept good film went along great pace there good humour well i would really recommend,i   t h o u g h t   f i l m   g o o d   b r e a k   u s u a l   m a r v e l   s u p e r   h e r o   f i l m s   m u c h   t r a d i t i o n a l   m a r t i a l   a r t s   f i l m   c o m b i n e d   m o d e r n   a s p e c t s   t h e   c o n c e p t   g o o d   f i l m   w e n t   a l o n g   g r e a t   p a c e   t h e r e   g o o d   h u m o u r   w e l l   i   w o u l d   r e a l l y   r e c o m m e n d,i t h o u g h t f i l m g o o d b r e a k u s u a l m a r v e l s u p e r h e r o f i l m s m u c h t r a d i t i o n a l m a r t i a l a r t s f i l m c o m b i n e d m o d e r n a s p e c t s t h e c o n c e p t g o o d f i l m w e n t a l o n g g r e a t p a c e t h e r e g o o d h u m o u r w e l l i w o u l d r e a l l y r e c o m m e n d
Awesome Fight Scenes,"When the movie first started... I felt like I was watching a ""foreign"" film. No English just Chinese with English subtitle? Didn't know what to expect in this movie. Then later on, the casts started speaking English & the awesome fighting scenes kicked in. OMG!! How exciting~ The fighting choreography was unbelievable. Just as good as Jackie Chan movies!

The storyline was alright but the CG was very good. They used lots of Chinese culture tradition, costume & symbols.

Follows the exact same formula as every other Marvel film,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" follows the same formula that's presented to audiences in any typical Marvel film; with that said, ""Shang-Chi"" gives you exactly what you expect, for better or for worse. There are no tricks up this movie's sleeve - there are no surprises. This film delivers a standard, well-executed superhero film, and whether or not you enjoy that will be completely up to you.

I, for one, am sick of the standard Marvel setup; I admit I have superhero fatigue, and unfortunately, ""Shang-Chi"" follows that typical superhero setup to a T - what that means is an extremely bland film both in character and plot, with only a few sparks of light along that tease a more compelling movie. The best parts of ""Shang-Chi"" involve Tony Chiu-Wai Leung; he plays a surprisingly complex and sympathetic villain and stars in some scenes that echoed the badassery of Asian gangster flicks. One scene where he takes out a room full of villains was so intense that I wish the movie would've followed that plot line instead of the subpar narrative we were left with. So, yes, Tony is great - everything else in ""Shang-Chi"" is mediocre, including the titular hero.

Iron-Man. Spider-Man. Black Widow. The Hulk. Dr. Strange. These are all Marvel superheroes that you can immediately picture because of their distinctiveness as characters. Black Widow is the sexy, badass assassin. Spider-Man is the naive but pure hearted schoolboy. Iron-Man is the cocky billionaire. Shang-Chi? He's the, um, actually, who is he? That's exactly what you'll be asking yourself because Shang-Chi barely has a personality in this film - his character is so dull and forgettable. And me saying that is in no way a slight to Simu Liu, because he's fine in the role; it's the script that does him no favors. When it comes to other characters, Awkwafina was in this movie, and I honestly was excited to see her in this because of how good she was in ""The Farewell."" And wow, my excitement was led astray because she was about as fun and entertaining as a prostate exam. I mean, sweet Jesus, she was so grating that I considered stuffing popcorn into my ears so I didn't have to listen to her speak anymore. Her jokes weren't funny, her dialogue was awful (I'm sure most of it was improvised), and her character was just plain annoying.

""Shang-Chi"" was also a very boring film, stuffed with poor dialogue and loads of exposition that had me nodding off in the theatre. A lot of lines were so cheesy, and so poorly delivered, that I found myself rolling my eyes. ""Shang-Chi"" also has the same amount of bland, uncreative editing and filming that is present in a lot of Marvel films - characters walk from room to room, and talk about this subject and that subject. It's not fun, it's not entertaining, and let's face it, it's horrendously boring. But okay, you're willing to look past that if the action is good, I get it! So how was the action?

The first act of this movie does have two good action sequences, and you've seen them both in the trailer - the bus fight, and the scaffolding fight. I hope you're not that big a fan of Kung-Fu, because after those two fights, you will no longer get well-choreographed action and will instead be treated to horrific CGI battles. I'm talking ring-on-ring action and unnecessary giant monster fights that had no place or purpose in this movie. And it's all boring to watch. I mean, you have basically the first ever Kung-Fu superhero movie, and you decide to only include two scenes of Kung-Fu? What were the creators thinking?

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was an exercise in disappointment. Instead of attempting to do something different, the film does exactly what you'd expect. And hey, if you love these kind of movies, you'll most likely love this film, and that's great - I hope you do. But if you're at all tired by the exact same formula that all superhero movies follow, ""Shang-Chi"" won't manage to lull you out of your superhero fatigue.", Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings

Average,"It's good action movie. Firstly, the scenario is pretty good, but it has nothing special, it's a little bit predictable. Secondly, the cast is awesome, I really like Akwafina in her role, she is very funny. Also I like Simu Lu as main character he is charismatic person. But my favourite is one character from past film of MCU (don't want to give spoiler). Thirdly, I like how the atmosphere of ancient Chinese culture was shown, but for me I want more. Fourthly, the fighting is good too.

Exciting; Possibly One of Marvel's Greatest Films,"Marvel has supplied their fans with a fast, fresh and funny superhero adventure with unconditionally perfect amounts of exhilarating action and fascinating characters. The enthusiasm noticeably kicks off with sustainable writing, in which an appealing plot is arranged and the excellent protagonists are propped. Secondly, director Destin Daniel Cretton recieves the role of brilliantly executing the visually-awakening tale.

There's no doubt that the real magic belongs to the epic sequences of fantastical action. With stylish martial arts battles and superb effects, Shang-Chi's epic movie lives up to both the hype and its genre. However, there are some ridiculous and unnecessary details. It's also significant to announce the fact that the amount of action is perfect! There's not too much to the point where it's tedious and not too less to the point where all that can be remembered is the dialogue.

Marvel flicks usually include several moments of bland dialogue between the superheroes. It occasionally grows fairly unexciting, but most of it is surprisingly gripping and the entertaining adventure rules over it. Alongside the massively-praised action is humour and heart-pumping credits scenes.

"Unlike most superhero movies, I tolerated this one...","As with all Marvel movies, the ending tries so hard to be enormous that it becomes visually impossible to comprehend.

Beautiful but boring,"Let me preface this by saying that my enjoyment of the movie may have been dampered by a poor night's sleep. That being said, the middle 45 minutes of this film had me nearly falling asleep, literally. The character development just couldn't hook me at all because it felt like they kept revisiting the same points.

On a positive note, the visuals and martial arts are absolutely spectacular. The first act of the film contains most of the martial arts and it is so crisp and well-choreographed. The final act flexes all of the CGI dollas and they make they already big budget stretch far, with some of the more impressive sights you will see in a Marvel movie so far. This movie didn't quite hit the 8/10 for me to recommend people see it in theatres, but lets tack that up to me being tired and you go see it anyway!",Let me preface this by saying that my enjoyment

Finally something good again from Marvel,"Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show. Not a single good movie since Captain Marvel, and nothing seemingly good coming over the horizon.

To be honest I have started to give up. Marvel have produced magnificent movies and great entertainment for many years, but lately it is like that magic has come off and they seem much more run of the mill basic with that, by now, boring Marvel feel. Marvel has tried to introduce more political correctness, more feminism, and more nonsense diversity, and it has all failed.

This movie however is not a failure.

Why?

This movie is simple, it is to the point, it follows tropes, cliches, and it is a classic heroes journey - which is exactly why it works!

Marvel took a classical story we all heard, read and seen before but they switched a few things around, kept some of that Marvel feel, and made it play out mainly in China and almost only with Chinese actors. And it works!

Imagine that? Sure you can find some political nonsense if you look hard enough, but who cares when you have great fight scenes, lovely sceneries, a great (but basic) story and brilliant well written characters.

We even get a villain that you understand, sympathise with and even feel a sting of ""ah, too bad"" about him.

This is how you make an action movie! Great stuff Marvel!

The points I deduct is due to the movie not being that amazing. They pull the heroes journey of sure, but we have also seen it done better. Sound is great, but not amazing, directing is great, but not amazing, etc. Etc. Everything about this movie is high class, greatly done, and well performed, but it is not on top, it is not amazing nor perfect.

I also have a few objections about the background story and the ending, but I am keeping this spoiler free so...

8/10. This is a great movie and highly entertaining, and definitely worth the ticket price. Go see and get your faith in Marvel restored.",Marvel has not done much good lately  2 horrible TV shows  and 1 bad TV show  Not a single good movie since Captain Marvel  and nothing seemingly good

I give it Ten Rings!,"Let me commence by saying this movie is by far one of the most-fun, action packed Marvel movies ever!

Shang Chi kicks ass,,,,,,,,
Fantastic new entry to the MCU,"I'm not someone who is a fan of action movies. I'm really not. But even here, there's no denying the action sequences are brilliantly executed and have a lot more of a hit than most of the marvel movies out there.

Although Simu Liu falters a little bit as a leading man, he has a truly impressive cast to support him. Awkwafina is brilliantly funny and quippy as she always is. And Tony Leung, the complex antagonist and the hero's father, has the most depth in this film.

The visual effects are beyond beautiful. They reminded me of Ferngully, and the nature I observed as a child. Good stuff!

There are some surprising cameos that are both hilarious and wholesome.

It was so good to see it in Imax after such a long cinema hiatus. Definitely check this one out!",I m not someone who is a fan of action movies  I m really not  But even here  there s no denying the action sequences are brilliantly executed and have a lot more of a

Another fabulous addition to MCU's Phase 4!,"The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.

The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.

Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.

Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.

Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings.

His inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed 'Small Tiger' among the Five Tiger Generals of Hong Kong Cinema

The flashback sequences help to build up Shang Chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir-apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac, and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father's murderous tendencies, as his son, he is inadvertently drawn to the Mandarin's world of violence and carnage.

The films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise-laden post-credit sequences tie into both Doctor Strange's world of Mystic Arts as well as a possible connection that the Ten Rings has to alien technology.

As always, the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its Phases is a joy in itself.

It is due to the well-written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that Shang Chi stands out while the eye-catching CGI and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product.

Another wonderful new addition to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on.

Highly recommended. A must watch.

Welcome back Marvel!,"After a disappointing Marvel entry with Black Widow, Shang-Chi is the return to form movie Marvel needed to bounce back off on. With solid performances, great setpieces, fun action sequences, and some emotional depth and humour to it, it's the type of film you need to see on the big screen and just go along with the journey and fantastical elements. It's also paced well and intriguing for the runtime it has.

The direction is solid and the characters get a good amount of screen time each to develop and have well placed flashback sequences. The martial arts fights are pretty well done and the CGI creatures look interesting with their designs and have good special effects. Overall, it's very well done and I didn't think Marvel could keep going, but they proved they can still make great stuff when they care about it.

A solid superhero adventure...,"Like many, I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang-Chi has already left me hopeful for the series' future. I literally know nothing about this character but I found his film debut to be a solid superhero adventure; well acted, effectively character-driven, occasionally funny, rich with cultural representation and booming with swift and stylized martial arts action. It has what I hoped I was going to get from Black Panther: inclusivity AND an interesting world and narrative. I'm 100% all for representation but the story and characters must be pronounced, too and I just found this entry to be a lot more distinguished and captivating.

Although Shang-Chi treads the familiar origin story formula, there's a few fresh twists and turns that uniquely sets this character's journey apart from the others. Though the first half is decently entertaining with some identifiable drama and fast-paced yet slightly derivative set-pieces in urban environments, the second half is where the film really turns on (at least for me). The Chinese philosophy kicks in, the mythology is abundant, there's tons of visually striking imagery, a fantastical setting, loads of insane action choreography. The Asian representation is just off the chain and I was so enraptured by it. It doesn't feel contrived, I sensed a great deal of respect for it and all the while an engaging story was unfolding. A nice balance. I was very satisfied with what I saw. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi's world and how it'll tie in with other stories yet-to-come. Very cool movie. Soulful, cultural and action-packed.",Like many  I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang Chi has already left me

Shang-Chi,"I was really looking forward to this film, and was excited to see shang chi in the MCU. It started out good with an interesting father, and son character development. As the film continued, it seemed to rely very heavily on the CGI. After a while all the CGI felt bloated and overwhelming. The acting was well done, by everyone in the film no weak links. Was hoping this film, would have had a more grounded plot like Iron Man.",I was really looking forward to this film  and was excited to see shang chi in the MCU  It started out good with an interesting father  and son character development  As the film continued  it seemed to rely very heavily on the CGI  After a while all the CGI felt bloated and overwhelming  The acting was well done  by everyone in the film no weak links  Was hoping this film  would have had a more grounded plot like Iron Man ,I was really looking forward to this film  and was excited to see shang chi in the MCU  It started out good with an interesting father  and son character development  As the film continued  it seemed to rely very heavily on the CGI  After a while all the CGI felt bloated and overwhelming  The acting was well done  by everyone in the film no weak links  Was hoping this film  would have had a more grounded plot like Iron Man ,I was really looking forward to this film  and was excited to see shang chi in the MCU  It started out good with an interesting father  and son character development  As the film continued  it seemed to rely very heavily on the CGI  After a while all the CGI felt bloated and overwhelming  The acting was well done  by everyone in the film no weak links  Was hoping this film  would have had a more grounded plot like Iron Man ,I really looking forward film excited see shang chi MCU It started good interesting father son character development As film continued seemed rely heavily CGI After CGI felt bloated overwhelming The acting well done everyone film weak links Was hoping film would grounded plot like Iron Man,i really looking forward film excited see shang chi mcu it started good interesting father son character development as film continued seemed rely heavily cgi after cgi felt bloated overwhelming the acting well done everyone film weak links was hoping film would grounded plot like iron man,i   r e a l l y   l o o k i n g   f o r w a r d   f i l m   e x c i t e d   s e e   s h a n g   c h i   m c u   i t   s t a r t e d   g o o d   i n t e r e s t i n g   f a t h e r   s o n   c h a r a c t e r   d e v e l o p m e n t   a s   f i l m   c o n t i n u e d   s e e m e d   r e l y   h e a v i l y   c g i   a f t e r   c g i   f e l t   b l o a t e d   o v e r w h e l m i n g   t h e   a c t i n g   w e l l   d o n e   e v e r y o n e   f i l m   w e a k   l i n k s   w a s   h o p i n g   f i l m   w o u l d   g r o u n d e d   p l o t   l i k e   i r o n   m a n,i r e a l l y l o o k i n g f o r w a r d f i l m e x c i t e d s e e s h a n g c h i m c u i t s t a r t e d g o o d i n t e r e s t i n g f a t h e r s o n c h a r a c t e r d e v e l o p m e n t a s f i l m c o n t i n u e d s e e m e d r e l y h e a v i l y c g i a f t e r c g i f e l t b l o a t e d o v e r w h e l m i n g t h e a c t i n g w e l l d o n e e v e r y o n e f i l m w e a k l i n k s w a s h o p i n g f i l m w o u l d g r o u n d e d p l o t l i k e i r o n m a n

Not a bad Marvel movie!,"The action and camera work in particular, along with the cast were very impressive!

"Arthritic Cheetah, Toothless Dragon","Wow! Another Marvel film. YaY! I'm not sure what I watched, but I know I've seen it at least 50 times before. Boring and cliche Superhero Plot, cheesy dialogue, dull acting. Been There, Seen That Special Effects.

CROUCHING NOCORN,"Twelve year old me loved this movie. It is big, bold, colourful, action packed, fun, funny, and has flying dragons. Cranky codger me says no to flying dragons. Sorry to any preteens peeking in (highly unlikely), flying dragons are a silly figment of someone's imagination. A movie with flying dragons is difficult to take seriously. Sorry kids. There is also some shocking news about Santa Clause, but let's save that for another day.

The good news here: Marvel again steps up to the plate in their inclusivity transformation of what movie making can and should be. They also manage to keep the rest of their superhero Universe from ruining what is a pretty good martial arts film by inserting the briefest of brief Marvel cameos to keep the all important story arc threaded. As usual for the studio, the supporting cast is pretty sweet. Ben Kingsley with a Ringo accent absolutely slays. Ronnie Chieng in a brief but outrageous cameo absolutely slays. Awkwafina in a major cameo absolutely slays. Tony Leung as the dark father and ring master absolutely slays, slays a lot.

The bad news: let's face facts, it may not be possible to make a good martial arts movie. Just when things get interesting we get a fight sequence where combatants, while absorbing what should be lethal blows, magically fly backwards unscathed. Zero gravity time baby! Why is this a thing? Used to be done with wires, so very obvious, and oddly enough, even with CGI at the ready, we still get that bizarre old school wire look. Homage has its limits. And lastly and most sadly the rousing cast of secondary characters pretty well squeezes Simu Liu into a not so main character role. Kinda forgettable if truth be told. That's a problem. A big problem.

The really cool highlights in ""Shang-Chi"", like the morphing forest maze, are a series of disconnected sequences that seem parachuted in, not integral to the story. As is often the case in the Marvel Universe, someone in the art department went a little crazy. With ""Black Panther"" it was the robot rhinos, and here it is a bizarre shimmering, sequinned horse hybrid (a hornless unicorn, so a nocorn?). Oh and then there are the cute furry, winged animals (get ready for the Xmas plush toy stampede) who somehow survive without any orifices. No really: nothing goes in, nothing goes out, and yet it survives, and also communicates!

Shame about all these niggling details, but they do ruin what could be a grand cinematic experience, an epic of epic proportions, though relentlessly formulaic, a family affair that nicks Shakespearian conflict, culminating with volcanic battle scenes of archery, catapults, swords, and uh, oh yeah, flying dragons.

The Marvel Universe is making strides, especially with the dark and moody ""Black Widow"", and the hilariously over the top, potty-mouthed ""Deadpool"". ""Shang-Chi"" is a heroic stray away from the usual masked heroes in tights genre, but it just needs less than more. A lot less. Chop chop.

The next phase of the MCU is off to a great start.,,,,,,,,
Welcome to the Club,"A very welcomed addition to the MCU, and any Avengers to come. 'Shang-Chi' kung-fu's it's way to top tier MCU territory, especially when it comes to origin stories.

Perhaps this generations 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', both of which are visual spectacles to behold. 'Shang-Chi' is full of beautiful creatures, costumes, martial arts, and acting. Probably the best fighting in the MCU, which makes sense (though Cap and Winter Soldier fighting is my personal favourite). The real Mandarin makes his debut and does not disappoint, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung was fantastic. All the other cast members were very likable as well. A few appearances from other MCU characters, including a surprising one that somewhat redeems himself.

A refreshing Marvel superhero movie in that it primarily focuses on itself, but has tons of potential to jump right in with other Marvel storylines. The MCU still holds lots of excitement for the future with characters like Shang-Chi.",A very welcomed addition to the MCU  and any Avengers to come   Shang Chi  kung fu s it s way to top tier MCU

"""Shang-Chi"" Brings Balance to the MCU","For nearly ten years after its inception, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was dominated by the adventures of white men. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had to fight to get her own film this year, while her male co-stars got entire trilogies . ""Black Panther"" reinvigorated the franchise with its celebration of African culture in 2018, proving that the Marvel brand didn't have to be so beige. ""Captain Marvel"" became the first MCU film to be fronted by a woman. Now, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" marks the first Asian-led film. Not only does the film feature the first Asian protagonist, it also features a predominantly Asian cast and crew, which, thankfully, give this franchise a much needed change in perspective.

The Ten Rings have been around for nearly a thousand years, gifting their wearer, Wenwu, immortality so that he may rule with unmatched strength. After centuries of building an empire out of blood, Wenwu was turned away from a life of violence by Ying Li, a guardian of the mystical land of Ta Lo. When heartbreak struck shortly after, Wenwu picked up the rings once again, causing him to go down a dark path, and his son, Shang-Chi, to run away to the United States. Now after ten years, the son must come home to confront his father and become who he was truly meant to be.

Similar to what Ryan Coogler was able to do with ""Black Panther"", co-writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton brings out the best of this new world as he is able to handle the mountains of establishing exposition. His use of flashbacks may be a bit liberal, especially as the film reaches its climax, but they're used meaningfully to build upon a story focused on character and culture.

Without a leading acting credit to his name, Simu Liu takes the titular role by storm as he navigates this typical hero's journey with charm and composure. Mixing a bit of T'Challa with Tony Stark, Shang-Chi is a hero battling with his past and future. Liu and Cretton strike a great balance as Liu hands himself over to Cretton's material in the somber moments, and Cretton lets Liu's comedic instincts light up the room.

Veteran Tony Leung brings the same melancholic energy to Wenwu as he did in his roles with Wong Kar-wai, particularly his work in ""In the Mood for Love."" Leung layers this villain and distances him from the average world dominator. He carries a stillness about him that inspires fear and compassion, two things that have made some of the greatest villains.

The overall narrative within a Marvel film is evenly composed of the plot and the action. Thankfully, Cretton blends both those halves together as he imbues the setpieces with the qualities of the wuxia genre, taking after such films as Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (also starring Michelle Yeoh) and Zhang Yimou's ""House of Flying Daggers."" The action often tells as much of the story as the dialogue, particularly in the gracefully dazzling opening sequence. But there's also room for brutality as the first act ends with a tower-scaffolding brawl where Shang-Chi's emotions turn him into a raw killer. Not since ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" has the action been so impactful on a technical and emotional level.

When allowed to be its own film, ""Shang-Chi"" is quite the spectacle. But when it gets forcefully molded into a Marvel film, the results are less than stellar. Even after all his work with the story and action, Cretton can't break free from the third-act visual effects extravaganza that holds this franchise like an iron vice. It's a shame as the smaller familial moments do more for the mind and soul than the forgettable litany of explosions that encompass the final thirty minutes. Being that this is the 25th film in the franchise, I've come to expect that level of disappointment.

Thanks to its multi-talented cast and crew, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of the better origin stories within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action may (rightfully) be the selling point, but the heart of the film lies within its characters, telling a familiar story on an impressive scale.",For nearly ten years after its inception  the

Great superhero entertainment with a classic storyline,"The charm of this movie comes from the setting of the main characters, showing a reflection of today's world, where Asian culture and the way of life in the west creates an environment of searching for one's own identity and place - this is where we meet Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) first. A young adult trying to navigate through his life far away from his family in the city of San Francisco. His partner in crime is his best female friend Katy (Awkwafina).

Simu Liu's character arc in this film is not significant. Although he makes a solid protagonist, his own character development is de minimis. Awkwafina, by contrast, steals the film as the ordinary person caught up in the epic power struggle. Her trademark zingers and bemused quips make her the perfect foil against the escapist superhero world that she- and we as the audience- are thrust into. Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) is a subtly effective Marvel villain with a compelling family backstory; he is a cinematic antagonist with the most idealism and righteous sense of purpose since Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"".

Michelle Yeoh as Shang-Chi's aunt Jiang Nan has again some great fighting scenes which stand up to her wonderful performance in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Overall this movie has great fighting scenes, extraordinary effects, especially the flying dragons which are delightful to watch. Highly recommended for everyone who likes superheroes and a touch of mysterious fairytales.",The charm of this movie comes from the setting of the main characters  showing a reflection of today s

"""Welcome to the circus""","It's always fun to go to the theater for a new MCU production -- a chance to see something **new** that you know will be well produced and will keep on stretching their shared universe of superheros. With Shang-Chi it looks like their Phase 4 is well and truly launched, and you can already glimpse what Marvel Studios' overall approach is going to be. (More below.)

Just like Black Widow was Marvel's run at doing a James Bond-type film, Shang-Chi is their try at doing the Chinese martial arts thing. The result is a kind of compromise Westernized version that falls between two poles. For sure though, you'll be entertained. There's more than enough action, a lot of strikingly beautiful settings, and fun characters. But before I forget -- the mid-credits scene is one of the best they've ever done and totally worth staying for. (That's where the quote I put in the title above comes from -- a certain familiar character telling Shang-Chi to sure, come on in and join the craziness.) It does the usual thing of tossing the baton forward to whatever the next production will be, but it's stylistically so clever that it really stands out.

And the film itself: it fills up its 2:12 runtime with a whole lot of material and a lot of characters. Maybe too much. The third act in particular veers off onto a fantasy-type track that doesn't entirely fit well with the previous hour and a half of setup, and the scenes in that last section suddenly feel more rushed. Gone are the days of the first Iron Man or Thor or Ant-Man movies with their lean, linear storylines and single well defined themes. Instead, Marvel now seems to want to overstuff every one of their productions, even if they involve 'secondary' MCU characters, and turn them into epics. More and bigger is not always better, is it?

I did like the cast. Marvel always does an impressive job bringing in good people. Nice to see there are no less than 4 (!) major roles for females, as opposed to 2 for males, and they mix and match well. Of the mostly young cast though, I thought the older pair (Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh) really stood out -- they effortlessly dominate the screen when they are on. Leung's character could have been a stock, one-dimensional scenery-chewing villain, but he's much more nuanced than that. Simu Liu (the lead role, Shang-Chi) is not exactly a great actor just yet, but he's athletic and cute and attractive with a sense of humor and for this role he doesn't need to be much more than that. Awkwafina, as Katy, does her usual turn with comic relief and side commentary with a dash of romance. As for Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley) -- that came out of nowhere and he's absolutely out of place, but somehow it works partly because of his pet that rises to Disney levels of cuteness.

About Phase 4. The first three cycles introduced and used particular major characters that were all required to fit under the Avengers umbrella. Now it's the post-Avengers era and from their scheduled series of releases up through 2023, we'll see a much more diverse slate of characters and stories that don't obviously fall under a single umbrella. If they do have a Master Plan for something equivalent to the Avengers, it's hard to see what it is. Maybe, they'll use this new freedom just to show us interesting stories in a bigger universe.",It s always fun to go to the theater for a new MCU production    a chance to see something   new   that

Instead  Marvel now seems to want to overstuff every one of their productions  even if they involve  secondary  MCU characters  and turn them into epics  More and bigger is not always better  is it   I did like the cast  Marvel always does an impressive job bringing in good people  Nice to see there are no less than      major roles for females  as opposed to  for males  and they mix and match well  Of the mostly young cast though  I thought the older pair  Tony Leung  Michelle Yeoh  really stood out    they effortlessly dominate the screen when they are on  Leung s character could have been a stock  one dimensional scenery chewing villain  but he s much more nuanced than that  Simu Liu  the lead role  Shang Chi  is not exactly a great actor just yet  but he s athletic and cute and attractive with a sense of humor and for this role he doesn t need to be much more than that  Awkwafina  as Katy  does her usual turn with comic relief and side commentary with a dash of romance  As for Trevor Slattery  Ben Kingsley     that came out of nowhere and he s absolutely out of place  but somehow it works partly because of his pet that rises to Disney levels of cuteness   About Phase   The first three cycles introduced and used particular major characters that were all required to fit under the Avengers umbrella  Now it s the post Avengers era and from their scheduled series of releases up through   we ll see a much more diverse slate of characters and stories that don t obviously fall under a single umbrella  If they do have a Master Plan for something equivalent to the Avengers  it s hard to see what it is  Maybe  they ll use this new freedom just to show us interesting stories in a bigger universe ,It always fun go theater new MCU production chance see something new know well produced keep stretching shared universe superheros With Shang Chi looks like Phase well truly launched already glimpse Marvel Studios overall approach going More Just like Black Widow Marvel run James Bond type film Shang Chi try Chinese martial arts thing The result kind compromise Westernized version falls two poles For sure though entertained There enough action lot strikingly beautiful settings fun characters But I forget mid credits scene one best ever done totally worth staying That quote I put title comes certain familiar character telling Shang Chi sure come join
